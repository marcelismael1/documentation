AWS Fundamentals

## Most popular AWS services are
# Computing
EC2 (Elastic Computing)

# Storage
S3 ( storage service, Simple Storage Service ) Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) stores data as objects within resources that are called buckets. You can store as many objects as you want within a bucket, and you can write, read, and delete objects in your bucket. Objects can be up to 5 TB in size.
Amazon EBS- Amazon Elastic Block Store provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated inside an Availability Zone to protect you from component failure, which offers high availability and durability. Amazon EBS volumes offer the consistent and low-latency performance that you need to run your workloads.
Amazon EFS - Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable, elastic file storage for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It is straightforward to use, and it offers a simple interface that allows you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily.

# load Balancing
ELB ( Elastic Load Balancing)

# Database
RDS ( Amazon Relational Database Service) -  we should define the hardware we want to use
DynamoDB - DynamoDB you donâ€™t need to define the underlying hardware

# Scaling
Scaling Group help create a scaling group with options to scale up the EC2 instances when the applications are on heavy load.

CloudWatch: is the service that monitors all actions and follows metrics and based on that take actions (spin up new EC2 Instances)
Cloud Trail: Logs every action taken on the cloud

# Cost Management
Amazon Cost Explorer:  visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time + You can create custom reports
AWS Budgest: set a budget and issue alarms based on certain period of time and Thresholds
AWS Pricing Calculator

----  AWSOME TOOL ----
AWS Trusted advisor: Powerfull tool that can can gives advices and recommendation to optimize the instances
	( it can advise to optimze Cost - Perfomance - Security - Fault Tolerance - Service Limits)

############ AWS Fundamentals: Addressing Security Risk ####################

-- Security is based on shared responsablity ( secrurity of the could and secrurity in the could)
-- Compliance: We include services in the scope of our compliance efforts based on the expected use case, feedback and demand. If a service is not currently listed as in scope of the most recent assessment, it does not mean that you cannot use the service.

# IAM , Identity and Access Managemt:
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. 

> Create new user and select to give it API access or Console access
> assign policies to set what resources the user can access (there are pre buildin policies)
> Set password or autogenerate
> then we have the URL that can be used for login
> from IAM>Users we can set MFA method


# Organisations
AWS services that helps creating groups and Organisational Units (OU)

# Authentication and Authorization modes that AWS supports
>>> A user from company login to use AWS servies from AWS account
>>> follow security best practices for granting least privilege access and enables you to manage fine-grained permissions for your AWS services and applications. IAM roles enable you to grant resources access to data without distributing passwords, or API keys, or hard-coding credentials in your source code.
>>> Users regestration and authenticating for an application (Sign Up and Sign in)

### AWS Security Services ###

# AWS Organisation 
Create OU and groups and it helps with BILLING

# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Manage users and Groups,
> Manage IAM Users
> Manage IAM roles and permissions
> Mangage Federation account ( we can use and software that support SAML 2.0)

We can right IAM policies as JSON ( there are automatic generators and there is a simulation service to test policies)

# AWS SSO

# Amazon Cloud directory
> Create directory ( for many solution) it is flexible  unlike LDAP

# Amazon Cognito
Allow you to integrate with other identity providers to gain access ( we can have AWS manage users or we can use our own users and directory ( evern Microsoft active directory)
