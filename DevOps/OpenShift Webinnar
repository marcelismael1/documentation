OpenShift

Jody Hunt
# The hardned version on K8s

# CyberArk uses a Vault to store secrets

initcontainer
summon
oc get pods


# OpenShift demo
cd to container
labctl e # exec into container


# K8s secrets only use base64 encodeing - not secured
# K8s uses env variables and it is dangerous we can get env variables easily
env | grep <Variable Name>


# OpenShift provid secretless connection where the application never gets the crids
# Using broker


Summary

The solution, is to have an authenticator. you should authenticat and then get 8 mins token to get secrets from
the authenticator.

They have 4 scenarios to handle secret sharing with the vault

1- Rest API
2- Using Summon to get the secrets
3- using K8s secrets
4- Secretless (without sharing secrets instead using a broker)
