ObjectId has a unique form
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/


ObjectId(<hexadecimal>)
Returns a new ObjectId value. The 12-byte ObjectId value consists of:

	a 4-byte timestamp value, representing the ObjectId’s creation, measured in seconds since the Unix epoch
	a 5-byte random value
	a 3-byte incrementing counter, initialized to a random value
While the BSON format itself is little-endian, the timestamp and counter values are big-endian, with the most significant bytes appearing first in the byte sequence.

Methods and Attributes
ObjectId() has the following attribute and methods:

Attribute/Method	Description
str	Returns the hexadecimal string representation of the object.
ObjectId.getTimestamp()	Returns the timestamp portion of the object as a Date.
ObjectId.toString()	Returns the JavaScript representation in the form of a string literal “ObjectId(...)”.
ObjectId.valueOf()	Returns the representation of the object as a hexadecimal string. The returned string is the str attribute.
